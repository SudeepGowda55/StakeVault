# Avail-Nexus-SDK-Feedback

## 1. Sample Projects & End-to-End Examples

### Current Gap

The documentation lacks complete, working sample projects that developers can clone and run immediately. While there's a basic demo repository, it doesn't cover diverse real-world use cases that would help developers understand the full SDK potential.

### Recommendation: Add Complete Sample Projects

**Purpose**: Provide end-to-end working examples that developers can:
- Clone and run in under 5 minutes
- Use as starting templates for their own projects
- Reference for implementation patterns
- Learn best practices from production-ready code

### Suggested Sample Projects to Add:

#### 1. Cross-Chain Payment Processor
- Accept payments from any chain
- Merchant dashboard with unified balances
- Webhook integration examples
- Production deployment configuration
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js + Nexus Widgets + PostgreSQL

#### 2. Multi-Chain DeFi Dashboard
- Portfolio aggregation across chains
- One-click rebalancing to highest yields
- Integration with Aave, Compound, Uniswap
- Real-time analytics
- **Tech Stack**: React + Nexus Core + The Graph

#### 3. Social Tipping Platform
- Peer-to-peer cross-chain tips
- Creator earnings dashboard
- Tip consolidation features
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js + Nexus Widgets + IPFS

#### 4. Gaming Treasury Manager
- Multi-chain tournament registration
- Prize pool distribution across chains
- Multi-sig integration for guild management
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js + Safe + Nexus SDK

#### 5. Cross-Chain Invoice System
- Business invoice creation and management
- Multi-chain payment acceptance
- Automated currency conversion
- Accounting exports
- **Tech Stack**: Next.js + Nexus Core + PostgreSQL

## 2. Interactive API Reference Documentation
<img width="2293" height="1106" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/feec7cfd-1141-497e-ada8-2fbcedab1b58" />

### Current Gap

The API reference documentation at https://docs.availproject.org/nexus/avail-nexus-sdk/nexus-core/api-reference currently contains only static code examples. While the code snippets are comprehensive, developers cannot interact with the API directly from the documentation.

### Recommendation: Add Interactive API Interface

**Inspiration**: The Pyth Network's Hermes API documentation (https://hermes.pyth.network/docs/) provides an excellent example of interactive API documentation with:
- Live request builders where developers can test endpoints directly
- Real-time response visualization
- Parameter input fields with validation
- Automatic code generation for multiple languages
- Authentication testing within the docs(reduces the hassle of tokens)

## 3.Missing: Gas/Fee Estimation API Reference

**Current Issue**: The documentation lacks a dedicated API reference section for gas and fee estimation, which is critical for developers building production applications where users need to understand transaction costs upfront.
